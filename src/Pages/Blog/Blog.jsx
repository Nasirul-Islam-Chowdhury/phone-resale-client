          What are the different ways to manage state in a React application?
        </h1>
        <p className="mt-4">
          <span className="font-bold">1. Local component state: </span> React
          components have their own local state, which can be managed using the
          useState hook. You can define a state variable and update its value
          using the provided setter function. This approach is suitable for
          managing state that is confined to a specific component and does not
          need to be shared with other components.
          <br />
          <span className="font-bold">2. Context API:</span> React's Context API
          allows you to create a global state that can be accessed by multiple
          components in the component tree. It provides a way to pass data down
          the component tree without having to pass props explicitly at every
          level. You can use the createContext function to define a context, and
          then use the Provider component to wrap the relevant components and
          provide the state. Components that need access to the state can use
          the useContext hook to consume the context.
          <br />
          <span className="font-bold">3. Redux:</span> Redux is a popular state
          management library that provides a predictable state container for
          JavaScript applications, including React. Redux stores the application
          state in a single centralized store, and components can subscribe to
          parts of the store's state using the connect function or the
          useSelector hook. Actions are dispatched to modify the state, and
          reducers handle these actions to update the state. Redux is suitable
          for managing complex state that needs to be shared across many
          components.
          <br />
          <span className="font-bold">4. MobX:</span> MobX is another state
          management library that allows you to create observable state and
          automatically tracks dependencies between state and UI. It uses
          observable objects and reactive functions to manage state. With MobX,
          you can define observables, computed values, and actions to modify the
          state. Components can observe the relevant parts of the state and
          automatically re-render when the observed state changes.

          How does prototypical inheritance work?
        </h1>
        <p className="mt-4">
          In JavaScript, prototypical inheritance is the mechanism by which
          objects inherit properties and methods from their parent objects.
          Every object in JavaScript has an internal property called
          [[Prototype]], which can be accessed via the __proto__ property
          (though it's recommended to use Object.getPrototypeOf instead). When a
          property or method is accessed on an object, JavaScript looks for it
          in the object itself. If it's not found, it looks up the prototype
          chain by accessing the [[Prototype]] of the object until it finds the
          property or reaches the end of the chain.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          When you access a property or method on an object, JavaScript first
          checks if the property exists on the object itself. If it doesn't, it
          continues the search in the object's prototype (its parent). This
          process continues until the property is found or until the end of the
          prototype chain is reached (which is usually the Object.prototype).
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          This inheritance mechanism allows objects to inherit properties and
          methods from their prototypes, enabling code reuse and object-oriented
          programming patterns in JavaScript.

          What is a unit test? Why should we write unit tests?
        </h1>
        <p className="mt-4">
          A unit test is a type of software testing where individual units of
          code, such as functions, classes, or components, are tested in
          isolation to ensure they behave as expected. The goal of unit testing
          is to verify the correctness of the individual units of code,
          independently from the rest of the system.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>Unit tests are important for several reasons:</p>

                <span>Unit tests can catch bugs and issues at an early stage, allowing developers to fix them before they propagate into more complex parts of the system.</span>

            <li className="mt-3">
                <span className="font-semibold">Facilitating refactoring:  </span>
                <span>Unit tests act as a safety net when making changes to the codebase. They provide confidence that existing functionality remains intact after refactoring or making modifications.</span>

                <span>Writing unit tests often leads to writing more modular, loosely coupled, and testable code. It encourages good coding practices and can help identify design flaws.</span>

        <h1 className="font-semibold text-2xl">React vs. Angular vs. Vue?</h1>
        <p className="mt-4">
        React, Angular, and Vue are three popular JavaScript frameworks for building web applications. Here's a brief comparison:
        </p>
        <ul className="mt-4">
            <li>
                <span className="font-semibold">React </span>
                <span> React is a JavaScript library, not a full-fledged framework. It focuses primarily on the view layer of an application. React uses a component-based architecture, where UIs are built by composing reusable components. React relies on a virtual DOM for efficient rendering and provides a declarative syntax for defining UI components. React is known for its simplicity, performance, and vibrant ecosystem.</span>
            </li>
            <li className="mt-3">
                <span className="font-semibold">Angular  </span>
                <span>Angular is a comprehensive JavaScript framework developed by Google. It offers a complete solution for building web applications, including a full-fledged framework, powerful tools, and extensive features. Angular uses a component-based architecture and employs TypeScript as its primary language. It provides features like two-way data binding, dependency injection, and a powerful CLI for scaffolding and building projects. Angular is suitable for large-scale enterprise applications.</span>
            </li>
            <li className="mt-3">
                <span className="font-semibold">Vue </span>
                <span>Vue is a progressive JavaScript framework designed for building user interfaces. It aims to be approachable and flexible, allowing developers to adopt it gradually within existing projects. Vue uses a component-based architecture similar to React and Angular. It provides features like reactive data binding, a template syntax, and a powerful CLI. Vue is known for its simplicity, ease of learning, and smooth integration with existing projects.
